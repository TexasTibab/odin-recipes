        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 venison roasts (2-3 pounds each)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup kosher salt</li>
                <li>1/4 cup coarse black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Barbecue sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
                <li>3 Tbsp yellow onion, minced</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp apple cider venagar</li>
                <li>6 Tbsp water</li>
                <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp ancho chili powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
                <li>2 tsp course black pepper</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a small pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the butter and onions, then saute&#769; 
                until translucent. Whisk in the remaining ingredients and bring it to a soft boil. 
                Reduce the heat and <br>let the sauce simmer for about 15 minutes to reduce. Transfer 
                to a blender (or use an immersion blender) and pure&#769;e until smooth. Set aside about 
                1/2 cup of the sauce and dilute it with <br>1-2 tablespoons of water to use for mopping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Trim the silverskin on the outside of the roast and season liberally with salt and 
                pepper. Cover and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare your smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions using your choice 
                of wood or pellets. Set the temperature around 180&deg;F.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the venison on the top rack of the smoker if possible. Place a container or 
                foil tray filled with water on the bottom rack directly underneath the meat to 
                release steam. Smoke for <br>30 minutes until the outside is dry and tacky and then 
                mop the surface with the barbecue sauce. Continue to mop every 30 minutes for 2-3 
                more hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Generously baste the meat with the barbecue sauce again, then wrap it tightly in 
                either pink butcher paper of aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return the meat to the smoker and increase the heat to 200&deg;F. Use a meat 
                thermometer to check the temperature. You should be able to feel the tenderness of 
                the meat when pricking it. <br>Pull the meat when it reaches about 180-190&deg;F. 
                internally. Don't let it get past 200&deg;F. This might take anywhere between 8-12 
                hours to achieve, depending on the size of the roast.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, rest the venison for 30 minutes, wrapped in an additional layer of foil 
                and placed iin an oven or cooler to keep warm. Slice it into thin pieces and serve 
                with barbecue sauce, <br>coleslaw, potato salad, pickles, and onions.
            </li>
        </ol>
