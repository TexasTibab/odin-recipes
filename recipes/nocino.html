        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon-sized glass jar</li>
                <li>20 to 30 unripe walnuts, halved or quartered. (Wear gloves, they'll stain your skin.)</li>
                <li>1 quart 190-proof Everclear</li>
                <li>3-6 whole cloves</li>
                <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>Peel of 1 lemon</li>
                <li>Additional herbs and spices to taste</li>
                <li>1 to 2 cups maple syrup or a simple syrup of 2 cups granulated sugar dissolved in 3 cups water. (This isn't needed until the first 40-day maceration is complete</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place your haved walnuts and herbs (chopped, torn, or crushed) in the jar, add 
                    the Everclear, and put a lid on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shake the jar to make sure everything is incorporated and let sit for 40 days. 
                    Some people say let it sit in the sun, some people say cool and dark.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After 40 days, pur through a coffee filter to strain out all of the solids.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add your maple syrup or simple syrup to your filtered liquid and stir.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add 1 to 2 cups of water to taste. It is recommended you leave it strong, as 
                    it mellows with age and is meant to be drunk in small, potent doses.
                </li>
                <li>Stir everything well and let age a minimum of another 40 days. The flavor will 
                    continue to develop and build surprising layers of charm for many years.</li>
            </ol>
