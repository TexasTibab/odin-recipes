            <li>1 (14oz) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped</li>

            <li>8 oz. cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. garlic powder</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                To prepare fresh stinging nettles, bring a pot of water to a boil. Using tongs to 
                handle the nettles, blanch young leaves and stems until wilted - about 30 seconds. 
                Transfer to a bowl of <br>ice water to stop cooking. Then drain and squeeze out as 
                much water as possible. Roughly chop wrung nettles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except 
                Mozzarella cheese. Season to taste. Spray an oven-prooof ramekin or dip bowl and 
                transfer cold dip <br>into it. Sprinkle Mozzarella cheese on top and bake in a 350 
                degree oven for 30 minutes, or until heated through and top becomes toasty.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve hot with tortilla chips. You can also prepare this dip and keep warm in a 
                mini slow cooker.
