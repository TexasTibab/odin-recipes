        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Filling</h3>    
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups small, green Mustang grapes</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch or flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp lemon juice</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Crust</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cubed</li>
                <li>1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp rendered deer tallow, frozen and grated</li>
                <li>ice water</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Filling</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix all ingredients together.</li>
                <li>Place the filling mixture in a bot and boil until grapes are soft.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt, stir to mix. Add in cubed 
                    butter and grated deer tallow. Cut into the flour with a large fork or pastry 
                    blender. You are looking for a bebbly texture that varies in size. Work fast, 
                    and if you feel that the fats are melting, throw the entire bowl in the fridge 
                    to cool down before continuing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once mixed, add in ice water a few tablespoons at a time. Start off with 2 to 
                    3 tablespoons, mix by hand, then add 1 tablespoon at a time until you can form 
                    a ball with the dough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roll the dough into a ball and split in half. Wrap each half individually with 
                    plastic wrap, and refrigerate for an hour at least before rolling out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    At this point you can wrap the dough tight and refrigerate or freeze for later 
                    use, or preheat the oven to 350&deg;F. and prepare a filling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lightly flour your work surface and roll out one of the pie dough balls to a 
                    roughly 12-inch circle. Grease a 9-inch pie pan, and place the pie dough in 
                    the pan. Fill and decorate as desired and bake until set, about 50 min.
