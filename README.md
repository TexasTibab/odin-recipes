# odin-recipes
A sample web page to practice my html.

The purpose of this page is to test and develop
my basic knowledge of html that I have primarily
learned from The Odin Project.

I will supposedly be sent back to this file in
the future to fix the page up with some CSS as
well.

I am planning, for now, to include recipes 
inspired by my interest in hunting, fishing,
and gathering with a focus on main ingredients
which are accessible to me in my geographic
region.
